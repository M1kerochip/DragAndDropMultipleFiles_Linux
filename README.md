# DragAndDropMultipleFiles_Linux
Drag and Drop multiple files into the file list, and hit Execute to run a linux command under Windows 10 using wsl.exe

![Program interface](_Screenshot.png)

Requires .net 4.7

Remembers the path to the exe and the parameters.

I wrote this just so I didn't have to keep typing out multiple paths to files on the Linux shell in Windows 10.

You will need the Windows subsystem for Linux installed, along with a Linux distribution from the Windows Store. eg Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE etc
